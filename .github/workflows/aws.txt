Cloud COmputing : 

Email Service : 

sends an email ==> Gmail ==> Home , Cyber cafe  ==> A server running remotely.. 
DropBox, GDrive ==> Internet, Valid Cred ==> You can access all data.. 

Server ==> configuration (1M Customers) ==> QUote ==> Order (dell/hp/ibm/lenovo/rackspace) ==> 3-4 weeks to deliver ==> 100% Upfront ==> Place the server ==> Network rack , Cooling systems , UPS, Physical security

Cloud ==> Need server ==> Launch it, (2 days = 48 Hours)


Pay-as-you-go ==> Advantage of cloud computing..
Pay-as-you-grow ==> 10000 Increase config

Email : Root Account (Highest privilages on AWS account)
Enable MFA on AWS Account on root: 

Physical MFA device : 
Virtual MFA devices : smartphone : Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator, Authy-2-factor.. 
U2F Key : Yubi2Key : 

S3 Service : Storage Service : Gdrive
Ec2 service : Server.. 

Sharing root credentials with all these users..????  Ans : NO

S3User : s3 service : S3FullAccess Policy 
EC2User : ec2 service : EC2FullAccess Policy 
TL : all services and application : 
Monitoring team : Read Only : 

IAM : Identity and Access Management : We can create Users, groups.. and we can manage user acceses based on their job roles / requirements.. 


Step 1 : Provide a valid username, 

Select AWS access type : 
--> AWS Management Console : GUI : Browser : Username, password & Sign-In URL.. 
--> Programatic Access : CLI : API, SDK, AWS CLI, 3rdparty : AccessKey ID & Secret Access Key (Dedicated session)


Step 2 : Set Permissions.. 

--> Create a GROUP, add "perission" to group.. Add user to the Group.. 
--> COpy permissions from an Existing user.
--> Attaching policy to the user.

Policy : Permissions on our AWS document.. 
--> Document that consists permissions on our aws account. Writtens in JSON format. 

Task : Create an IAM user with "Administrator Access Policy" and login verify he is able to change the support plan or not..???  NO..

Task 2 : user "Task 1" user, and try to access Billing Dashboard. How you can provide access to this user on Billing dashboard.

How to enable billing access to an IAM user.?

Goto "My Account" ==> Enable "IAM billig access". 
Create an IAM ==> "Admin / Power user" or manually associate a policy "Billing".


policy : Set of permissions on our AWS account.

--> AWS managed policy : 
--> AWS managed policy - Job Function : 
--> Customer Managed policy : 


AdministratorAccess : Provides full access to AWS services and resources.
PowerUserAccess : Provides full access to AWS services and resources, but does not allow management of Users and groups.  (Administrator - IAM)

Administrator - s3 : Avinash  = Admin - S3 = "YES/NO"

Creating policy : Deny S3

Step 1 : Choose the service s3/ec2/iam
Step 2 : Actions : all (DENY)
Step 3 : resources (All resources)


Policy : allow ec2 and s3.. AllowEC2andS3


Implicit allow : Whatever the resoiurce access we required, we need to associate to the user. He'll get only those resources access. Remaining all resources "NO".

**Always Deny have highest priority.

Explicit Deny : We can give any permission to an IAM user (Admin/poweruser).. If we add DENY at any level, DENY will takes place. 

implicitly deny : If you don;t add any policy, automatically it'll take DENY.

Policy Simulator : We can use this to evaluate the poliy/ permissions for a policy.

Permission Boundary :  Set a permissions boundary to control the maximum permissions for the user.

Inline Policy : Onetime use policy.. A policy for single usage/user.


Credential report: Track user log-in: Password expirations.. 

ARN : Amazon Resource Name : 


IAM user : s3 full Access : Want him to activate MFA.. ???

IAM is a global service..
