S3 : Simple storage service : 

block based storage : EBS / Instancestore :  Designed to run OS.. 
object based storage : s3 : Designed to store the flat files.. We cannot install/run the applications.. 
network based storage : EFS / FSx : Storage over the network.. 


S3: Object based storage.
S3 platform global, doesn't required region selection. 
Whenever we are creating a bucket, i'll ask us to choose the region.
In s3 we use buckets to store the data. (Bucket = Folder with unique namespace)

Bucket name limitations: 
--> Bucket names are unique across the globe.
--> Min 3 char, Max 63 Char..
--> Should not start with . , end with ., adjesent .., No special characters
--> No Capital letters
--> Should not resemble IP address format.


Standard URL : 
https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/bucketname/objectname
https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/avinashh.website/A.png

Virtual path : 
https://bucketname.s3.regioncode.amazonaws.com/objectname
https://avinash3.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/RDS+task.txt

https://bucketname.s3.amazonaws.com/objectname
https://avinash3.s3.amazonaws.com/RDS+task.txt

==> If we want to share any data from our bucket, firstly enable "Public access settings" at bucket level.

S3 Versioning : 
--> Track all changes happening on our s3 objects.
--> Works as a backup option too

When Versioning : HIDE..
--> Whatever the file we delete, we'll get a delete marker.
--> Delete the Delete Markernto get that object back.. 

When Versioning : SHOW..
--> FIle delete permenetly


Lifecycle management rule : WE can transit objects storage class, and we can trigger to delete the objects automatically. 


Website : 
--> S3 Supports static website hosting option.

bucket name should be same as domain name (avinash.website)
--> For our website 99.99% avilablitiy 99.999999999% Durability

--> We need to provide atleast read only on our data to load the website.

SRR (Same Region Replication) / CRR (Cross Region Replication) : 

Task : Create bucket 1 and bucket 2 in Same region and configure the SRR repolication between these buckets.


KMS : Key Management Service : 


--> In-Transit Encryption
	--> SSL (Secure Socket Layer) / TLS (Transport Layer Security)

--> Server Side Encyrption / at-rest
	--> SSE - S3 (Encryption and decryption manged by s3 platform)
	--> SSE - KMS (KMS Generated and Manged keys encrypt and decrypt the data)
	--> SSE - C (Customer Provided) (Customer generated and uploads the keys to KMS, 
					KMS is going to manage the encry & Decry process)

--> Client Side Encryption : Customers who dont want to uplaod any unenrypted data to s3 platform, they can choose CSE. On him ON-Premise/Corporate network by using his own keys he is going to encrypt the data.. That encrypted data, we can send to aws.


AES-256 / SSE-Se  and aws/s3 ==> Whoever have valid permissions on platform they can access the data.. == FREE TIER ELIGIBILITY

Customer Managed Key :

Symmetric : A single encryption key that is used for both encrypt and decrypt operations

Asymmetric : A public and private key pair that can be used for encrypt/decrypt or sign/verify operations


Key Administrator Permissions : 

Key Usage Permissions :

Object lock : 
--> Should be enabled when we create bucket. 
--> Versioning must be enabled. 

Governance mode can be disabled by AWS accounts that have specific IAM permissions.
Compliance mode cannot be disabled by any user, including the root account.


Transfer acceleration : If we want to upload / download data via edge locations.

Events : 
--> SQS : Simple Queue service ..
--> Lambda : Serverless architecture.. 
--> SNS : Simple Notification Service : 
	==> Navigate to "SNS" Create a "TOPIC" and add subscribers. 


Requester pays : Instead of bucket owner, who is requesting the data, he'll get charged for the request / data transfer.
